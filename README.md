## SSH Configuration Manager
Tired of trying to remember all those confusing keywords and options for your ssh configuration file? 
Copying and pasting from other Host entries only to forget to change one of the details?

**SCONF** exposes common settings and provides suggestions for obscure settings making it easy to manage your SSH configuration.
I know you're already a vim or emacs expert, but isn't this simpler?

*As this is in alpha,* I recommend you back up your ssh configuration file, if you have one. **SCONF** is only for editing Host entries, but all of your global entries will be kept intact!

`cp .ssh/config .ssh/config.bak`
